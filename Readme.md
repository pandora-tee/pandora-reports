# Pandora reports

Pandora allows to generate powerful HTML reports that are self-contained (i.e., a single HTML file), and that give details to all vulnerabilities in a given enclave.

This repository contains noteworthy reports we generated with Pandora for new and reproduced vulnerabilities. Note that we had to remove several reports due to licensing and as such, this folder only contains reports of open-source enclave runtimes.
